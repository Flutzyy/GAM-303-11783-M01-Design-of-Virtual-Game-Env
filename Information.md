ALPHA STAGE

Latest update: Added files directly from folder to github, and will update github every week until end of school term. When trying to use gitbash, I keep getting various errors and cannot for the life of me figure out how to fix them. It seems there are corrupted files that gitbash doesn't agree with, but will not tell me which files are corrupted.
